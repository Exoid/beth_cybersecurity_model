SHALLOW MODELS:
Both models have high accuracy on the training set, which is expected since the models are trained on this data.
For the test set, which is more indicative of how the model will perform on unseen data, the MLP has a higher accuracy (84.5%) than the SVM (83.7%).
This suggests that the MLP might be the better model, as it performs slightly better on the unseen data.
